## Description

This application generates a password ranging from 8 to 128 characters.
It can be any combination of lowercase, uppercase, nonzero or special characters!
It is a simple app that utilizes some simple html, some API selectors, and Javascript to take advantage of.
This project was built because sometimes users should be able to generate a safe and secure password with a few simple inputs, these passwords allow for protection against bruteforce and dictionary attacks.

Upon creation of the project, we learned about simple button selectors, some logic on how to handle the various text types, along with how arrays work, how confirm, prompt, and alerts, and most importantly how randomizing arrays could be utilized.



## Usage

To use this project, simple run it on the site linked above, enter your password length and hit "ok" for each string type one wants. Hit "cancel" if you don't want those types.

## Learning Points

The biggest learning point was understanding how Math.floor and Math.random were used.
Another big value was the ability to learn how to use DOM manipulators to select buttons and add functionality to the page itself.
The ability to load in different prompts and confirmations on the page was invaluable, as well as the basic logic needed to complete the task!

In the future, it would be good to refactor these functions so that the code is much more modular in nature.
Implementing a better randomizer method to get a more "true" random solution would be great too, but the one we have works fine.
